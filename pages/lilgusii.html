        <h1>Bio</h1>
        <p>Lil Gusii or Gusii, which real name is Antonio Cintora, was born in Zaragoza, Spain, the 3rd of November of 1999. <br/>
            He was grown alone with her mother, as his father was never his father, so that made him grow with a depression since the age of 15.<br/>
            The school never helped tho, as the schoolmates and the bullying were always there.<br/>
            He started making beats in 2019, when he was going through some rough times with one of her girlfriends, as a way to escape from reality and find<br/>
            a sound that he enjoyed, but those beats where never used until he started making his own music by the name of br.OK.en. <br/>
            Some of their songs got really popular on Soundcloud and Spotify, but he realized that all he was doing was trying to copy his idol Lil Peep.<br/>
            That's where he changed his name to become Gusii, Lil Gusii. <br/>
            He started doing emo rap/trap songs, also inspired by peep, but started finding his own sound by using different kind of beats from different artist, and getting more <br/>
            inspiration from his childhood idols: blink-182, My Chemical Romance, and many others. <br/>
            Now a days, he stills looking for a good sound, and maybe one day he will find it. <br/>
            In the mean time, he has some songs that you can listen, as he already released 2 albums:<br/>
            <ol>
                <li>Unknown Album</li>
                <li>A Sad Album for Sad Listeners</li>
            </ol>
            Also, he has released many singles so far and got so many fans on Instagram and Spotify.
